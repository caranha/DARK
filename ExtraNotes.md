Extra notes from my notebook. Organize these later.

- Create a simulation:
  - Terrain / Map size / Map simulation
  - Agents: Plants, Humans, Animals -- Predator and preys
  - Seasons based on simulated time
- TODO:
  - Water changes with time (seasons)
  - Shelter and teach agents to use shelter
- Data types for generating the world:
  - Chemistry / Fossils / Artifacts
- Ideas for the project:
  - Taxonomy of Agent Based Models (ABM)
  - Question: Impact of the data on the model: Data used to initiate
    the agents, to structure the model, and to validate the model
	- So the data is super important
	- If we focus on domain knowledge, we won't need to do a asspull
	- Data: Using data to create schedules / activities
	- Using data to create worlds
  - Model Validation: Valfram: *Validation Framework for Activity Based mModels*
- Need to do: Meta study of models: Papers that are trying to solve
  one problem in different ways (how people move, etc) by using
  models.
