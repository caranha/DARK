# Project Concepts

Digital Archeology Project -- Draft of the data assimilation design.

Loose ideas to guide the project in the future.

## Uncertainty
- Use ensemble of scenarios to consider the uncertainty of biases in
  the model.
## Initialization (Be careful to biases)
- Straight initialization by maps.
- Initialization by data (Terrain Generation from Data)

## Take Dying Rate into account
- (Claus) I don't remember what is the dying rate
- Rate from literature 
  - Due to food distribution
  - Animals (Prey/Predator Model)
  - Weather condition
- Multi-disciplinary understanding necessary

## Design
- Model conceptualization by layers (multiple maps to consider/sum)
  - Risk zones
  - Define size of maps
  - Archeological evidence based
  - Literature based (GIS stats distribution)

## Simulation timescale
- Convergence? / Steady-state conditions?
- Fixed time?
  - One season?
  - One generation?
  - Multiple generations?
  - Multi small interseasonal models? (What?)

## Seasons
- How many seasons? (Dry/Wet? Data?)
  - Justification, how significant are the seasons in our study areas?
  - What resources / layers are influenced by the seasons?
